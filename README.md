# 🍅 Pomodoro Timer

A sleek, minimalist productivity timer that helps you crush tasks with the time-tested Pomodoro Technique.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodoros," after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that inspired the method.

## Features

- 🍅 **Work Sessions**: 25-minute focused work periods
- ☕ **Short Breaks**: 5-minute breathers after each work session
- 🏖️ **Long Breaks**: 20-minute rewards after completing 4 work sessions
- ✓ **Progress Tracking**: Visual checkmarks show completed work sessions
- 🎨 **Soothing UI**: Calm color scheme to keep you in the zone

## How to Use

1. Click **Start** to begin your first 25-minute work session
2. Work until the timer finishes
3. Take the break that automatically follows
4. Repeat until your tasks are complete!
5. Use **Restart** anytime to reset the timer and session count

## Getting Started

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pomodoro-timer.git

# Navigate to the project directory

# Run the application

```

## Requirements

## Why Pomodoro Works

The technique harnesses the power of focused work sprints and regular breaks to keep your brain fresh. The time constraints create a sense of urgency that helps combat procrastination, while the breaks prevent burnout.

Happy focusing! 🍅
